# api-examples
Examples for using the Tech@NYU API. Full public documentation is hosted [here](http://apidocs.tnyu.org/).

We've created a [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org) compliant API for our club. It's hosted [here](https://api.tnyu.org/v2/), and we'd love for people to build things on top of it.

The things we've opened up for people are:

- Events API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2/events`
- Skills API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2/skills`
- Teams API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2//teams`
- Projects API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2/projects`
  - This is empty for now, but its schema is layed out in the documentation. If you'd like to build things on top of the Projects API consider our [DemoDays](http://demodays.co) website. We'd love to automate this in the future - adding events into the API and it updating on our DemoDays site.

We're also looking for people for our Infrastructure team! We do a lot of interesting stuff, mostly on the MEAN stack (Node, Angular, Express, and Mongo)! Though we've got bits of Python and Go in there too. If you're interested submit an issue on this repo.
