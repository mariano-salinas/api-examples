Examples for using the Tech@NYU API.

We've created a JSON-spec reliant API for our club. It's hosted [here](https://api.tnyu.org/v2/), and we'd love for people to build things ontop of it.

The public documentation is hosted [here](http://apidocs.tnyu.org/). This is tentitive to new releases, and currently relies on v2 of the API.

The things we've opened up for people are:

- Events API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2/events`
- Skills API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2/skills`
- Teams API: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2//teams?include=memberships`
- Projects: `https://api.tnyu.org/v2/projects`
  - This is tentatively empty, but the schema for this is layed out in the documentation. If you'd like to build things ontop of the Projects API consider our [DemoDays](http://demodays.co) website. We'd love to automate this in the future - adding events into the API and it updating on our DemoDays site.

We're also looking for people for our Infrastructure team! We do a lot of interesting stuff, and our stack is Node, Angular, and much more! If you're interested submit an issue here.
